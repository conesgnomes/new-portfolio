          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <h3>Givemo was the culminating group project for my JavaScript course. The idea for this project was to create an app that allowed users to find charities in Portland, Oregon by category and easily make a monetary donation to them. In a world ever more cluttered by information, this app would allow users to cut through the noise and easily find causes they believe in to support. My group and I built the app in Angular 4, stored our data in a Firebase database, and used SASS for the styling. I played the part of principle designer along with one of my classmates, coming up with the overall UX and UI design for the application.</h3>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>We were broken into groups of four and had one week to design and code a fully functional Angular application. I proposed the idea of creating a mobile app that would allow users to find charities or non-profits in their local communitiy and make a donation to them with the click of a button.</p>

        <div class="givemo-overview-solution">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The app we developed accomplished everything we set out to do - allowing users to search a database to find charities that match specific categorical criteria while doing so in an easy-to-use and elegant fashion.</p>
