          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <h3>Givemo was the culminating group project for my JavaScript course. The idea for this project was to create an app that allowed users to find charities in Portland, Oregon by category and easily make a monetary donation to them. In a world ever more cluttered by information, this app would allow users to cut through the noise and easily find causes they believe in to support. My group and I built the app in Angular 4, stored our data in a Firebase database, and used SCSS for the styling. I played the part of principle designer along with one of my classmates, coming up with the overall UX and UI design for the application, while also helping code and style the app.</h3>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>We were broken into groups of four and had one week to design and code a fully functional Angular application of our choice. Inspired by our current socio-political climate, I wanted to develop an app that would remove as many barriers as possible in helping individuals give back to their communities and do so in a streamlined, elegant fashion. I proposed the idea of creating a mobile app that would allow users to find charities or non-profits in their local communitiy and make a donation to them with the click of a button.</p>

        <div class="givemo-overview-solution">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The app we developed accomplished everything we set out to do - it provided one-touch single-sign-on via Google, a landing page where users could track which charities they had already donated to, and a dynamic search screen that allowed users to search via category or charity name, all with an easy-to-use and attractive user interface.</p>
