      <h1>Hello there, my name is Connor. I’m glad you found my page.</h1>
      <h2>I’m a UX/UI designer and product person who likes to prototype with code, though I wouldn’t call myself a developer — I’d rather leave that work to the true devs. I just want to make digital experiences feel good and look pretty :)</h2>
      <p>My first interest lies in people. Understanding their motivations, interests, and what makes them tick. I think my undergrad in psychology fueled that fire, though I’ve always been a people person. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://strengths.gallup.com/default.aspx">Strenghsfinder</a> I’ve got a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/721/woo.aspx"> Woo</a>. I think I just like talking to people.</p>
      <p>My second love has always been art and design. When I was younger I lived in Sweden as an exchange student and to this day feel most inspired in my design work by the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_design">Scandinavian aesthetic</a> — straight, clean lines and products that perfectly blend form and function.</p>
      <p>In high school I was more interested in print design. I was one of three students in charge of designing our yearbook. I also went to yearbook camp. And was a camp counselor. Sounds nerdy? Think about it — an entire week to play with Adobe products and learn about layout, color theory, and typography! Sounds pretty dreamy to me.</p>
      <p>Fast forward a number of years and I found myself at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/">Nike</a> working as a product merchant, an offshoot of product management. Now what does merchandising have to do with UX you ask? In my mind, a whole lot. As a merchant, my primary task was to understand our target consumers and ensure the products I was selecting to put out into stores fit with those consumer’s wants, needs, and desires. This meant conducting interviews and focus groups, creating personas, and building case studies to best understand the consumer nuances in the marketplace, then translating those findings into product briefs for our product creation teams. When you dig a little deeper, I've found many of the skills and experiences I gained working in product to bleed over into the world of UX.</p>
      <p>Although I enjoyed my experiences at Nike, I came to learn that clothes and shoes were not the kinds of products I wanted to build my career around and found myself more excited about the idea of working with digital technology. To facilitate a transition into digital tech, there was a lot of learning I had to do. I returned to school, learned to code, learned the basics of UX and UI design, began reading everything I could on the topic (I recently finished <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/design-systems-book/">Design Systems</a> by Smashing Magazine and learned so much! Check it out if you haven’t yet), and started designing and building projects.</p>
      <p>This brings us to now. I finally feel like I have found a dream career. I have a number of freelance projects and an internship under my belt and am looking for my next opportunity to make a big impact at a cool company.</p>
      <p>You know anyone hiring?</p>
