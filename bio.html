      <h1>Hello there, my name is Connor. I’m glad you found my page.</h1>
      <h2>I’m a UX designer who likes to play with code, though I wouldn’t call myself a developer — I’d rather leave that work to the true devs. I just want to make things look pretty :)</h2>
      <p>My real interest lies in people. Understanding their motivations, interests, and what makes them tick. I think my undergrad in psychology fueled that fire, though I’ve always been a people person. According to Strenghsfinder I’ve got a lot of Woo. I think I just like talking to people.</p>
      <p>My second love has always been art, design, and aesthetics. And food. But that doesn’t help this narrative much…</p>
      <p>When I was in high school I was more interested in print design. I was one of three students in charge of designing our yearbook. I also went to yearbook camp. And was a camp counselor. Sounds nerdy, but think about it — an entire week to play with Adobe products and learn about layout, color theory, and typography! Sounds pretty dreamy to me. Plus, being nerdy is cool.</p>
      <p>Fast forward a number of years and I found myself at Nike working as a product merchant. Now what does merchandising have to do with UX you ask? In my mind, a whole hell of a lot. As a merchant, my primary task was to understand our target consumers and ensure the products I was selecting to put out into stores fit with those consumer’s wants, needs, and desires. This meant conducting interviews and focus groups, creating personas, and building case studies to best understand the consumer nuances in the marketplace, then translating those findings into product briefs for our product creation teams. There is it — people, research, products.  Sounds pretty UX-y, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, merchandising was lacking the element of creativity I so enjoy. I needed a new path, so I returned to school, learned to code, learned the basics of UX and UI design, and began reading everything I could on the topic (I’m currently loving Design Systems by Smashing Magazine — check it out if you haven’t yet).</p>
      <p>This brings us to now. I finally feel like I have found my spot. I have a number of freelance projects and an internship under my belt and am looking for my next opportunity to make a big impact at a cool company.</p>
      <p>You know anyone hiring?</p>
